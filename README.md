                              BOOK COLLECTION PROJECT OUTLINE

Overview

  Books, movies, vinyls, funko pops, the list can go on and on. Who doesn’t have something they love collecting? We’re designing an app that allows a user to have an account and       build a collection and review for all their items. We’ve started with books that users might have read along with a wishlist of books they want to add.
